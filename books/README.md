## Create a GitHub Repository that will be deployed to Heroku

Do you have a method to create a PDF?

I use OpenOffice, which has an option to export my content to PDF.
The PDF is used for printing. Part of print preparations are to upload the PDF files.
The size of the page is set in your document determines the size of the print page. When you export to PDF, the page size is retained. 

In my 6x9" book, my font is Times New Roman, 13 point size.
A rule of thumb, is to have 10-12 words across a page. This is what the eyes and brain like when reading.

When you create a print a book, you state your copyright. No need to do anything else to register a copyright.
You can search and read to see what is suggested.
I did see that there is a formal process for copyright, but since 
Sample document with my copyright notice: [book front part](https://github.com/tigerfarm/tfpfiles/blob/master/books/content/poetry/Ps6x9c-front.pdf)
